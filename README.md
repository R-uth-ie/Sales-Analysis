This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, 
we seek to identify trends , make data driven recommendations and gain a proper understanding of the company's performance

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis "Sales_Data.Csv" file, containing detailed information about each sales made by the company.

### Tools

- Power query- Data analysis
- Excel - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/preparation

In the initial data cleaning I performed the following task:

1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with

```Sql
    Select * from table
    Where cond = 2;
```

### Results/findings

 The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.



### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.


### Limitations


I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would
have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a
few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is
a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue
